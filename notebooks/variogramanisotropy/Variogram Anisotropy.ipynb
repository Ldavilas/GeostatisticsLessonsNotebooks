    "\n",
    "The following notebook provides a demonstration of the theory presented in [Calculation and Modeling of Variogram Anisotropy](https://geostatisticslessons.com/lessons/variogramanisotropy). Obtaining the correct anisotropy of the variograms is important in geological modeling. This notebook demonstrates multiple methods of inferring variogram anisotropy. Methods are applied to both dense and sparse data, which allow for clearer illustration of different concepts. The progression and aim of this notebook is further detailed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Dense and Sparse Datasets**\n",
    "    - Simulate a gridded realization with a \"true\" underlying variogram\n",
    "    - The gridded realization is treated as the dense dataset (40,000 points)\n",
    "    - The gridded realization is randomly sampled to generate the sparse dataset (200 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Circle Variogram with Dense Data**\n",
    "    - Calculate experimental variograms in 16 evenly discretized directions in the (x,y) plane, applying narrow and wide azimuth tolerances\n",
    "    - Fit a variogram model to all 16 directions simultaneously, autofitting the angles and ranges of the principal directions; his is repeated for each of the two azimuth tolerance cases\n",
    "    - Compare the variogram models against the true variogram. It is shown that dense data permits reliable inference of the principal directions of anisotropy, but the variogram model associated with the wider azimuth tolerance (not strictly required here, but will be with sparse data) case understates the true anisotropy\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Circle Variogram with Sparse Data**\n",
    "    - Repeat the approach described above with the dense data, though only using a necessarily wide azimuth tolerance for the experimental variogram\n",
    "    - It is demonstrated that the inferred principal directions and anisotropy are reasonable, though predictably less precise than with the dense data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variogram Volume with Dense Data**\n",
    "    - Calculate a variogram volume (or map) directly on the dense data, which permits stable population of all volume bins\n",
    "    - Fit a variogram model to the variogram volume, thereby extracting the principal directions and ranges\n",
    "    - Compare the fit variogram model against the true variogram model, showing very precise reproduction\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variogram Volume with Sparse Data (Neutral Model)**\n",
    "    - Demonstrate that the direct calculation of a variogram volume on sparse data is not stable\n",
    "    - Generate a neutral model to smooth short scale variability and reveal underlying structure\n",
    "    - Calculate a variogram volume on the gridded neutral model, thereby populating all bins in a stable fashion with the smoothed continuity\n",
    "    - Fit a variogram model to the variogram volume of the neutral model, identifying the principal directions, though not ranges, as the neutral model is too smooth\n",
    "    - Calculate experimental variograms on the data along the identified principal directions, before fitting with with a variogram model\n",
    "    - Compare the inferred anisotropy from the circle search and variogram volume (with neutral model) approaches, where the latter is shown to provide better reproduction of the true variogram in this case\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Moment of Inertia (MOI)**\n",
    "    - Demonstrate moment of inertia as a final method for determining principal directions of continuity\n",
    "    - Extract the principal directions from the neutral model variogram volume using the MOI tensor matrix\n",
    "    - Calculate experimental variograms along the principal directions and fit a variogram model, before comparing to earlier results \n",
    "\n",
    "The presented workflow may be extended to represent other deposits. Inline annotations with each step will note practical adjustments that may be necessary for this extension.\n",

    "Geological formations are almost always anisotropic. The first step in variogram determination is to establish the principal directions. This notebooks demonstrates methodologies for determining principal directions of continuity and models of anisotropy from sparse data. Experimental directional variograms, neutral models, and variogram volumes are useful tools to help with this first step. After finding the principal directions, it is necessary to compute reliable directional variograms. The tolerance and apparent anisotropy must be considered carefully. Dense and sparse data were used to illustrate how large variogram tolerances may be practically necessary, but will understate the true anisotropy.\n",
